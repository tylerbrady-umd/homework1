Question: What is the difference between a merge and a rebase?

Answer: Both merge and rebase combine changes from one branch to another 
branch, however how they do this is different. Merge takes the changes 
from say the main branch and when this is merged with progress it will 
create a new commit with the combined history of the two branches onto the 
progress branch. Compare this to rebase which will take the progress 
branch and place it at the end of main making a new history of commits 
that combine the commit history of the two in a linear fashion.
 

Question: What is a remote repository?

Answer: A remote repository is a central repository usually on something 
like GitHub where changes committed on oneâ€™s local repository are pushed 
to so others can see such changes allowing for collaboration amongst teams.
